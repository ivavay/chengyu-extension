🈷️ a chrome extension for learning chinese idioms 

💡 inspired by my recent trip to Taiwan where I feel like I was lacking in my Chinese abilities, I created this chrome extension to help you 
and myself learn chinese idioms every time you open a tab! The words are in traditional Chinese (cuz Taiwan) and there's pingyin to help you learn to pronounce!

🔜 next step would be to add a sentence to each idiom to help with knowing how to use it in a context. Or I could add a share button for sharing the word via text or Twitter!
